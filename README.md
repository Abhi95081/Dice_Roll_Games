# Dice Roll Game

This is a fun Android Dice Roll game built using Jetpack Compose. The game simulates rolling a dice with animated rotations and plays a sound when the dice is rolled. The dice rotates alternately in clockwise and counterclockwise directions, providing a dynamic 3D effect with each roll.

## Features

- **Smooth Dice Rotation**: Dice rotates alternately in clockwise and counterclockwise directions for a dynamic 3D effect.
- **Random Dice Result**: Each time the dice is rolled, one of the six faces is randomly chosen to be displayed.
- **Sound Effect**: A dice roll sound effect is played when the dice is rolled.
- **Simple and Interactive UI**: A button that triggers the dice roll and displays the result with an animation.

## Requirements

- Android Studio with support for Kotlin.
- Jetpack Compose (latest stable version).
- Android SDK (API 21+ recommended).

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dicerollgames.git
2. Open the project in Android Studio
Open Android Studio and select Open an existing project.
Navigate to the cloned project directory and open it.
3. Build and run the app
Once the project is loaded in Android Studio:

Build the project.
Run the app on an emulator or a connected device.
4. Enjoy the Dice Game!
Press the "Roll the Dice" button to see the dice roll with animation and sound.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

MainActivity.kt: The main entry point of the app, containing the DiceGame composable that renders the UI and handles the dice roll logic.
res/drawable/dice_1, res/drawable/dice_2, res/drawable/dice_3, res/drawable/dice_4, res/drawable/dice_5, res/drawable/dice_6: Dice images representing the faces of the dice.
res/raw/dice_roll.mp3: The sound effect for the dice roll that plays when the button is clicked.
How the Dice Game Works
1. Dice Roll Button:
When the user taps the "Roll the Dice" button:
The app plays a dice roll sound effect.
The dice undergoes a smooth rotation animation, alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise directions.
After the animation finishes, a random dice face is shown.
2. Dice Animation:
The dice rotates in a 3D manner by alternating between clockwise and counterclockwise directions, creating a dynamic visual effect.
3. Random Dice Result:
Once the dice finishes its rotation, a random number (between 1 and 6) is displayed on the dice face.
Libraries Used
Jetpack Compose: For building the UI declaratively.
MediaPlayer: For playing the dice roll sound effect (dice_roll.mp3).
Material3: For Material Design components and theming.
